### Introduction
This was our final "cross-pollination" project at Turing School of Software and Design. Our team of two front-end students and two-backend were tasked with developing a complete app from scratch using new technologies. The app allows a user to log in (project is currently a prototype with one universal user) and view a map with pins representing local events near them. The user can search events by date or activity type. A user can also create activities to post to the "activity board" choosing from a list of set activities or creating their own custom activity. The user can choose to "sign up" for an activity or decide to "cancel" if they are unable to attend.

### Directions for Use
- When loading the app the user is greeted with a login screen asking for username and password. Currently, the app is a prototype and doesn't require a login, you may simply press the `sign in` button.
- Upon signing in...

### Project Learning Goals and Requirements
This is a unique opportunity that presents some valuable goals:
- Ultimately, demonstrate knowledge you‚Äôve gained throughout Turing
- Use an agile process to turn well defined requirements into deployed and production ready software
- Gain experience dividing applications into components and domains of responsibilities to facilitate multi-developer teams. Service oriented architecture concepts and patterns are highly encouraged.
- Explore and implement new concepts, patterns, or libraries that have not been explicitly taught while at Turing
- Practice an advanced, professional git workflow (see whole-team expectations)
- Gain more experience using continuous integration tools to build and automate the deployment of features in various environments
- Build applications that execute in development, test, CI, and production environments
- Focus on communication between front-end and back-end teams in order to complete and deploy features that have been outlined by the project spec
